# SudokuSolverJS
Sudoku Solver Project I decided to work on after finishing a JavaScript coding course.

While working on the JavaScript course I noticed at the end of the course there was a Sudoku Checker Project, which at the time I mistook for a Sudoku Solver.
So since I had already been thinking about it I decided to take the plunge and try it out!
